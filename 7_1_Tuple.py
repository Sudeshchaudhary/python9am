# tuples are used t store multiple items in a single variable.
# a tuple is a collection which is ordered, unchangeable and allow duplicates.
# tuples are fined size in nature i.e. we can't add/delete elements to/from a tuple.
# we can search any element in a tuple.
# tuples are faster than lists, because they have a constant set of values.

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "carrot")
print(len(fruits))
# fruits[1]="ball" tuple is unchangeable we can't replace it
print(fruits)
nos = (4, 7, 8, 4, 3)
#print(nos[1])
#print(nos[2])
#print(nos[4])

#decisions = (True, False, False)
